            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the 
                right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine 
                Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right 
                customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. 
                Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want 
                about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what 
                potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. 
                Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your 
                brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" />
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, 
                bringing customers directly to your website.

                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search 
                ranking and visibility for your business.

            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, 
                and you no longer need to advertise your page.
